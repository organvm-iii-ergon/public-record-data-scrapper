# Samples

This directory contains a synthetic, redacted sample dataset for the MCA lead-scoring workflow.
It is intended as a sellable demo artifact: easy to load in a spreadsheet from CSV and rich enough
for UI/API demos from JSON.

## Files

- `scored-mca-leads-sample.csv` - flattened 25-row lead list for spreadsheet demos.
- `scored-mca-leads-sample.json` - the same 25 leads with nested health, scoring, and growth signal details.

## Redaction Boundary

Every row is synthetic or redacted. Company names, secured-party categories, signal text, and record IDs
are fabricated for demonstration. The files contain no contact-level PII, no credentials, and no real
public-record identifiers. Do not use these rows for underwriting, solicitation, or compliance decisions.

## JSON Shape

The JSON file includes top-level `metadata`, `scoring_model`, and `leads`. Each lead mirrors the CSV
fields and adds nested objects:

- `health` with grade, score, sentiment trend, review count, violation count, and last update date.
- `score_breakdown` with intent, health, position, modifiers, final score, grade, confidence, and recommendation.
- `growth_signals` with synthetic signal type, description, detected date, score, and confidence.

## Scoring

Each `priority_score` is a 0–100 composite of three proprietary sub-scores — **intent**,
**health**, and **position** — combined under a proprietary weighting and adjusted by
industry and state risk modifiers, then bucketed into an A–F grade and an outreach
recommendation.

- **Intent** captures UCC filing recency, filing volume, active/lapsed/terminated pattern, and recent trend.
- **Health** captures synthetic review/sentiment/violation proxies.
- **Position** captures active UCC count, known MCA positions, and estimated payment burden.

The exact sub-score weights, modifier tables, and grade/recommendation cutoffs are part of the
platform's calibrated scoring engine and are not published. The sample values above are produced
by that engine so the output _shape_ is faithful; the calibration behind them is what the product
delivers.
