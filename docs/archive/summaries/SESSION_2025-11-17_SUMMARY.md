## 💡 Key Learnings & Notes

### Testing Best Practices Applied
1. **Comprehensive coverage:** Test initialization, core functionality, edge cases, errors
2. **Mock management:** Use `vi.mocked()` consistently, clear mocks in beforeEach
3. **Async handling:** Proper use of async/await, timeout configuration for slow tests
4. **Test isolation:** Each test suite is independent, proper cleanup in afterEach
5. **Realistic scenarios:** Tests mirror actual usage patterns

### Performance Considerations
- Rate limiting test requires 70s timeout (tests actual delay enforcement)
- Batch enrichment uses concurrency control (default: 5 concurrent)
- Scheduler uses configurable intervals (production: 24h, test: 1s)

### Architecture Highlights
- **Circuit Breaker:** 5 failures → open for 60s
- **Retry Logic:** 3 attempts with exponential backoff (100ms base delay in tests)
- **Event System:** Publisher-subscriber pattern for scheduler events
- **Priority Scoring:** Multi-factor (time: 50pts, growth: 30pts, health: 20pts)

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

**For Next Session:**

1. **Start with Database Setup** (quickest win)
   - Run PostgreSQL in Docker
   - Execute schema.sql
   - Test connection from services
   - Update services to use real database instead of in-memory Map

2. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test full ingestion → enrichment flow
   - Test scheduler with real data
   - Test multi-agent orchestration

3. **Production Data Sources**
   - Pick one state portal (NY recommended - best documented)
   - Implement Playwright scraper
   - Test with real data
   - Add error handling for real-world scenarios

**Long-term:**
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Add performance monitoring
- Deploy to staging environment
- Security audit (penetration testing)
