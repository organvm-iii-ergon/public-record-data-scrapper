# MCA Lead Data — Pricing & Product One-Pager

**UCC-MCA Intelligence Platform** turns daily Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) filings into
ranked, contact-ready Merchant Cash Advance leads. Every business that takes on
secured financing files a UCC-1 — we capture those filings the day they post, match
them to live businesses, enrich them with contact data, and score MCA likelihood so
your team works the hottest opportunities first.

> Public-record sourced. No reselling of third-party lists. Suppression against
> TCPA/DNC built in before any record ships.

  12-hour cycle so a lead's score reflects current conditions, not its capture date.

  webhook/API.
- **Cadence options:** daily drip, weekly batch, or real-time API pull.
- **Coverage today:** California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey. Additional states
  onboarded rapidly on demand via the repeatable State Factory pipeline (see `docs/playbooks/ADD_ONE_STATE_PLAYBOOK.md`).

## Volume Tiers & Example Pricing

Pricing is per qualified lead and steps down with volume. "Qualified" = a deduped,

recency). Illustrative rate card — final pricing set on the order form.

## Why It Converts

- **Recency-driven:** leads scored on days-since-filing, the strongest MCA timing signal.
- **Pre-suppressed:** TCPA/DNC checks run before delivery — you call clean lists.
- **Ranked, not raw:** a 0–100 score and a narrative per lead, so reps work top-down.
- **Public-record provenance:** sourced from state filings, defensibly compliant.
