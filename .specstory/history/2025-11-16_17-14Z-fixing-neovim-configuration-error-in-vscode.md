I can see you're experiencing a Neovim/Lua error related to VSCode module loading. This appears to be a configuration issue with your Neovim setup trying to load a VSCode-related Lua module that doesn't exist.

Let me help you resolve this. This is typically caused by:
1. A Neovim plugin configuration referencing VSCode
2. An init.lua or init.vim file with incorrect require statements

Let me search for any Neovim configuration files in your workspace: The error is coming from Neovim but there are no Neovim config files in this workspace. This suggests the issue is in your global Neovim configuration (typically `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` or `~/.config/nvim/init.vim`).

**To fix this error:**

1. **Quick fix** - Disable the problematic Neovim extension temporarily:
   - Close any Neovim instances
   - In VS Code, go to Extensions
   - Search for "VSCode Neovim" 
   - Disable or reload it

2. **Permanent fix** - Edit your Neovim config:
   ```bash
   # Edit your Neovim init.lua
   nvim ~/.config/nvim/init.lua
   ```
   
   Look for any lines with `require('vscode')` or `require("vscode")` and either:
   - Remove them if not needed
   - Wrap them in a conditional check:
     ```lua
     if vim.g.vscode then
       require('vscode')
     end
     ```

3. **Alternative** - If you're not using Neovim in VS Code, simply disable the "VSCode Neovim" extension.

Would you like me to help you check your Neovim configuration file, or would you prefer to handle this manually?

Your Code - Insiders installation appears to be corrupt. Please reinstall.
